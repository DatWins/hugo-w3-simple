# W3 SIMPLE

## _Keep it simple, but not simpler_


**W3 Simple** is a Hugo theme written by [Jesse Lau](https://jesselau.com) . The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal theme with W3 CSS included. 

I was just tired of my Wordpress Elegant Themes and wanted to make a simple Wordpress Themes based on W3 CSS.

However, when I googled "W3 Wordpress Themes" 3 days ago, I could not find any wordpress themes but found one Hugo theme named W3 basic.

I knew Hugo at that time. 

I can't help to want to migrate Wordpress to Hugo. But I found W3 basic theme was not really basic to me who is new to Hugo.

So I made this simple one.

 ## Hugo is really fast
 I just migrate my site from Wordpress to static page.
 The speed is 3 times faster.
 Here is the web page test result for Wordpress :

 And here is the new test with same page:
